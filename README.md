Small scripts that we have done along the completion of each of the labs for the ops430 course aswell as side projects I work on as I lesarn Python. More automation oriented projects will be added in the future.

Update 29/04/2020
I will add more content now that I have started my online python bootcamp. I just finished my first milestone project (Tictactoe2), which is a basic tictactoe game. The program checks for winning, tie and no winner scenarios. The program also obligates users to use corret input thanks to multiple loops and customized functions.
